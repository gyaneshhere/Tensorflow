DeepMind employs deep learning. 


DeepMind (https://deepmind.com/) is extremely productive and successful not only in the machine learning field (where they are supposedly the best in the world) but also in their efforts to communicate their findings to the world. In their blog, you can find all publicly available information about their research. 


After taking this course, you can easily read and understand their blog. Please follow the links below to read their accomplishments on their project WaveNet, which produced the most humanlike computer generated voice so far (integrated in Google Assistant).
